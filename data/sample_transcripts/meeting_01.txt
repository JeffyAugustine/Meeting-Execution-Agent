Jeffy: Okay folks, let's get started. We have about 20 minutes. Mira, wanna kick us off with where we stand on the roadmap?

Mira: Yeah, sure. So the Q1 roadmap is mostly set. Uh, we have two things still kinda hanging — the onboarding revamp and the advanced analytics pilot. I need clarity if onboarding stays top priority or if we push analytics forward.

Jeffy: Hmm, onboarding is still pretty painful for users, right? The drop-off’s bad?

Mira: Yeah, it's been a major pain point. User churn data shows a lot of folks dropping during onboarding.

Arun: Tech-wise, we could start backend work on analytics now, but the frontend visualization isn’t ready. If we rush, users get a half-finished experience.

Leah: From research, last week’s user tests showed people like the idea of analytics, but the onboarding friction is stopping actual adoption.

Jeffy: So onboarding is urgent and impactful. Analytics is important but less urgent. Mira, please update the roadmap to reflect that, and push analytics pilot to March?

Mira: Yep, I'll shift timelines.

Jeffy: Also, Mira, I want 3 concrete KPIs to measure onboarding success within 30 days. Can you do that by tomorrow morning?

Mira: Uh, yeah, that's doable. I'll have something by then.

Leah: Should we plan a quick usability test after the new onboarding prototype is ready? Nothing big, like two sessions max?

Jeffy: Sounds good. Keep it lightweight.

Arun: Engineering can do backend changes this week and UI next week. We're aiming for a Thursday internal demo.

Jeffy: Perfect.

Mira: Oh, marketing asked if onboarding is a big launch or silent update.

Jeffy: Silent. No ads or blog posts.

Leah: I'll keep messaging consistent.

Jeffy: Blockers?

Arun: Waiting on design assets tonight.

Leah: You'll have them by 8 PM.

Jeffy: Quick recap — onboarding top priority, analytics to March, KPIs tomorrow, demo Thursday, no marketing hype.

Everyone: Got it.

Jeffy: Alright, let’s dig into more details.

Mira: Okay, so for onboarding KPIs, I was thinking of tracking: first, completion rate within 7 days; second, time to first key action; third, NPS from new users post-onboarding.

Jeffy: Good start. What about drop-off points?

Mira: We'll instrument detailed funnel tracking to spot where users leave.

Leah: We saw biggest drop-offs around the second step, which asks for permissions.

Jeffy: Yeah, that permission screen is tricky.

Arun: Technically, we can optimize that screen by deferring some permissions, maybe ask later.

Mira: That could reduce friction. Should we test that variant?

Jeffy: Yes, put that in as an A/B test post-launch.

Leah: User feedback shows confusion on why certain permissions are needed upfront.

Jeffy: Could we add more explanatory microcopy?

Daniel (design, joining): Sorry to jump in, but adding short tooltips could help here.

Jeffy: Sounds good, Daniel. Can you work on that?

Daniel: Will do.

Mira: Another point — do we have the capacity to deliver all onboarding steps this quarter? Some features are still pending.

Arun: Some backend work is in progress, but we might have to cut scope if timelines tighten.

Jeffy: Let’s prioritize core onboarding steps first. Extras can wait.

Leah: For usability testing, do we have a recruitment plan?

Mira: Yes, targeting a mix of new users and those who dropped out previously.

Jeffy: Excellent. Make sure to record sessions for analysis.

Leah: Already planned.

Mira: Also, one risk — analytics pilot push might disappoint marketing.

Jeffy: We need to manage expectations. Leah, please help draft messaging to internal teams.

Leah: On it.

Arun: About analytics backend, if we delay pilot, can we use this time to improve data accuracy?

Jeffy: Absolutely. Use the extra time to fix data pipeline bugs.

Mira: For the roadmap update, do you want a formal doc or just a quick deck?

Jeffy: Deck with key changes and dates. Keep it tight.

Mira: Okay.

Leah: Are we planning any customer webinars post-onboarding launch?

Jeffy: Not immediately. Let’s see adoption numbers first.

Mira: Got it.

Jeffy: Now, about the Thursday demo — what exactly are we showing?

Arun: Core onboarding flow, backend integrated, UI mostly done, no fancy animations.

Jeffy: Good. No distractions.

Mira: Will product be ready to field questions?

Jeffy: Yes, Mira, you should be prepped.

Leah: I can prepare quick user feedback snippets for the demo.

Jeffy: Perfect.

Mira: What about post-demo action items?

Jeffy: Demo feedback gets collated, prioritized, and sprint backlog updated.

Leah: Should we invite customer success team?

Jeffy: Yeah, good idea.

Arun: QA is prepping test cases for onboarding. Will do smoke tests by Wednesday.

Jeffy: Excellent.

Mira: Is there any known blocker that can delay Thursday?

Arun: Design asset delay, but Daniel is on it.

Daniel: Yep, finishing final icons today.

Leah: I'll review those tomorrow morning.

Jeffy: Great.

Mira: For KPIs, we might want to add qualitative feedback, like “ease of use” rating.

Jeffy: Good call.

Leah: We'll add that to post-onboarding survey.

Jeffy: Okay, let’s talk about staffing. Any resource crunch?

Mira: Design is tight, Daniel juggling multiple projects.

Arun: Engineering headcount stable for now.

Jeffy: Can we get an intern in design?

Mira: I’ll push for it.

Leah: HR said they have candidates lined up.

Jeffy: Cool, please speed that up.

Mira: One more thing — do we want to build onboarding as modular pieces for future iterations?

Arun: Technically yes, but more upfront work.

Jeffy: Worth it. Build modular to avoid rewrites later.

Mira: Got it.

Leah: For user testing, some participants requested clearer error messages.

Jeffy: Definitely a must.

Daniel: Will work on error message designs next week.

Jeffy: Good.

Mira: Marketing still wants early heads-up on onboarding progress.

Jeffy: Weekly email updates to them.

Mira: Okay.

Leah: About analytics, any thoughts on how to frame pilot success?

Jeffy: Metrics like engagement rate, feature usage, and feedback scores.

Mira: Makes sense.

Arun: Need to clarify analytics data retention policy.

Jeffy: Compliance check with legal.

Mira: I’ll coordinate.

Leah: For onboarding, any plans to support multi-language in Q1?

Jeffy: That’s stretch — not for initial launch.

Mira: Okay.

Daniel: Visuals might need adjustments for internationalization.

Jeffy: Keep that in backlog.

Mira: Regarding user support, is there a help doc update planned?

Leah: Yes, updating onboarding help pages this week.

Jeffy: Great.

Mira: I think that covers most points.

Jeffy: Yeah, thanks team. Final quick recap: onboarding priority one, analytics pilot March, KPIs by tomorrow, Thursday demo on core onboarding, no marketing hype, intern request underway, modular onboarding build.

Mira: All noted.

Leah: Yep.

Arun: Ready to execute.

Daniel: On it.

Jeffy: Meeting adjourned.
