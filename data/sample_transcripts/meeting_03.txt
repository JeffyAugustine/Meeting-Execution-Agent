Elena: Hey team, thanks for joining. Let’s dive in. First up, hardware prototype status — Mark, how’s the new sensor array coming along?

Mark: Hey, yeah, the sensor array is about 80% assembled. Had some issues with the calibration on the temperature sensors, took longer than expected.

Jin: Calibration’s tricky. What’s the main challenge there?

Mark: The sensors are sensitive to ambient heat fluctuations. We had to redo the baseline measurements twice.

Elena: Okay, can you have it stabilized by end of the week?

Mark: I’m pushing for it, but might need extra help.

Jin: I can spare some time Thursday to assist.

Elena: Great.

Sofia: On the integration side, the firmware update we did last week caused some intermittent resets on the main control board.

Mark: Yeah, that’s affecting sensor readings too, right?

Sofia: Exactly. We’re tracking down the root cause, suspecting power spikes.

Elena: Any mitigation plan?

Sofia: Implementing a power smoothing circuit, hoping that helps.

Mark: I’ll coordinate with Jin to verify power supply stability.

Jin: Sounds good.

Elena: What about the battery subsystem? Any updates?

Mark: Batteries are rated well but the actual runtime is about 15% less than spec.

Jin: Might be due to firmware resets.

Sofia: Or maybe sensor power draw higher than expected.

Elena: Prioritize analyzing that this week.

Mark: Will do.

Sofia: Also, we’re prepping for a field test next month. Need to ensure all components pass stress tests.

Elena: Right, testing schedule?

Mark: Plan is next two weeks for lab tests, then a week of outdoor trials.

Jin: I’ll work on environmental noise mitigation in the firmware.

Sofia: Great. Regarding the mechanical mounts, we had some alignment issues during assembly.

Elena: How bad?

Mark: Minor, but could cause sensor misreads if not fixed.

Sofia: We’re designing adjustable mounts to compensate.

Elena: Good.

Mark: On software, I’m collaborating with Jin on improving sensor fusion algorithms to handle noisy inputs.

Jin: Yeah, working on a Kalman filter tweak.

Elena: Excellent.

Sofia: For documentation, we’re updating the integration guide this week.

Elena: Perfect, keep it current.

Mark: One blocker is the delay in custom cables — vendor moved delivery from Monday to Thursday.

Elena: Keep chasing.

Sofia: On team resources, anyone overloaded?

Jin: I’m good, but might need help with power analysis.

Mark: I can pitch in if needed.

Elena: Alright, if needed, Mark can support.

Sofia: Any safety concerns?

Mark: Not currently, but we’re monitoring temperature spikes.

Elena: Good. For demo planning, are we aligned on key features to show?

Jin: Sensors working reliably, battery endurance data, and stable firmware.

Sofia: Also, the new mounting design.

Elena: Let’s prep slides and data for that.

Mark: On testing, some intermittent firmware crashes were reported. We need to debug.

Jin: I’ll set up detailed logs for that.

Sofia: Good plan.

Elena: Any new risks?

Mark: Custom cable delays might push back integration.

Jin: Firmware instability could cause demo issues.

Sofia: Battery runtime variance needs attention.

Elena: Okay, risk mitigation is key.

Mark: On the positive side, sensor calibration is improving steadily.

Jin: Fusion algorithm updates look promising.

Sofia: Field test planning is on track.

Elena: Awesome.

Mark: For next week, prioritize calibration, firmware stabilization, and documentation updates.

Jin: I’ll focus on power and sensor fusion.

Sofia: I’ll track integration issues and help with testing.

Elena: Thanks, team. Final recap: sensor calibration and assembly 80% done; firmware reset root cause investigation ongoing; battery runtime 15% under spec; testing schedule in place; demo prep underway; risks around cables and firmware; documentation updates this week.

Everyone: Got it.

Elena: Meeting adjourned. Thanks all.
